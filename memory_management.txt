memory.limit(size = NA)

Arguments
max 	

logical. If true the maximum amount of memory obtained from the OS is reported, otherwise the amount currently in use.
size 	

numeric. If NA report the memory size, otherwise request a new limit, in Mb.
Details

To restrict memory usage on a Unix-alike use the facilities of the shell used to launch R, e.g. limit or ulimit.
