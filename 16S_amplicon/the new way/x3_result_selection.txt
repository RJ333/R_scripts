#choosing/selecting data

However, there are two ways to be more strict about which set of genes are considered significant:

    lower the false discovery rate threshold (the threshold on padj in the results table)
    raise the log2 fold change threshold from 0 using the lfcThreshold argument of results

If we lower the false discovery rate threshold, we should also tell this value to results(), so that the function will use an alternative threshold for the optimal independent filtering step:

res.05 <- results(dds, alpha=.05)
table(res.05$padj < .05)

## 
## FALSE  TRUE 
## 12841  4014

If we want to raise the log2 fold change threshold, so that we test for genes that show more substantial changes due to treatment, we simply supply a value on the log2 scale. For example, by specifying lfcThreshold=1, we test for genes that show significant effects of treatment on gene counts more than doubling or less than halving, because 21 = 2.

resLFC1 <- results(dds, lfcThreshold=1)
table(resLFC1$padj < 0.1)

## 
## FALSE  TRUE 
## 18368   196
